* Show unknown libusb error code in unknownLibUsbError


0.6.0.6

(Released on: Sun Dec 26 12:00:30 UTC 2010)

* Import missing (>>) in Utils (only when ghc < 7)
  Reported by Joris Putcuyps.


0.6.0.5

(Released on: Thu Dec 16 16:20:12 UTC 2010)

* Support text-0.11.

* Resolved some warning when compiling with ghc-7


0.6.0.4

(Released on: Sat Oct 23 00:15:14 UTC 2010)

* Support text-0.10.


0.6.0.3

(Released on: Thu Oct 21 21:37:50 UTC 2010)

* Tested with GHC-7 and modified to work with base-4.3.


0.6.0.2

(Released on: Wed Oct 6 22:06:43 UTC 2010)

* Support text-0.9.


0.6.0.1

(Released on: Mon Sep 13 05:48:41 UTC 2010)

* Fixed bug in Utf16LE encoding in getStrDesc.


0.6

(Released on: Sat Sep 11 14:19:36 UTC 2010)

* Renamed BCD4 to ReleaseNumber.

* Made StrIxs in descriptors optional.

* Refactored handling of string descriptors (internal change).

* Added strictness flags to all arguments of data constructors.


0.5.0.1

(Released on: Wed Sep 1 20:12:03 UTC 2010)

* Support text-0.8

* Prevent a potential space leak in the decoding of BCD values
  (Binary Coded Decimals)


0.5

(Released on: Mon Jul 26 05:48:59 UTC 2010)

* Fixed bug in all writing related functions:
  writeControl, writeBulk and writeInterrupt.
  I erroneously ignored the offset in the given ByteString.

* Fixed bug in getDevices
  Don't free the array when c'libusb_get_device_list returns
  c'LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_MEM.

* Fixed bug in 'setStandardTestMode'
  Wrong conversion from TestMode to Word16.

* Specify the length of the requested string in getStrDesc in
  characters instead of bytes.

* Moved the standard device requests to their own module
  System.USB.IO.StandardDeviceRequests

* Added System.USB.Unsafe
  This module is needed by the usb-enumerator package.

* Added convenience function 'readControlExact' which is similar to
  'readControl' but checks if the specified number of bytes to read
  were actually read. Throws an 'IOException' if this is not the case.

* Defined more instances for various types.
  Most types have now instances for:
  Show, Read, Eq, Data and Typeable

* Added type TimedOut = Bool

* Some refactoring and documentation


0.4

(Released on: Wed Jun 16 09:12:22 UTC 2010)

* Some reordering and naming of arguments:
  < type ReadAction = Timeout → Size → IO (B.ByteString, Bool)
  > type ReadAction = Size → Timeout → IO (B.ByteString, Bool)

  < type WriteAction = Timeout → B.ByteString → IO (Size, Bool)
  > type WriteAction = B.ByteString → Timeout → IO (Size, Bool)

* Return the iterator when the enumerator reads 0 bytes

* Restricted the enumerators to work on Word8 instead of a polymorphic
  elements This is to prevent readFromPtr to read outside allocated
  memory

* Use the package MonadCatchIO-transformers-foreign in
  System.USB.IO.Synchronous.Enumerator


0.3.1

(Released on: Sun May 2 20:23:24 UTC 2010)

* Made the descriptor types non-abstract

* Updated dependencies
  iteratee                  >= 0.3.5 && < 0.4
  transformers              >= 0.2   && < 0.3
  MonadCatchIO-transformers >= 0.2   && < 0.3

* Always include the Enumerator and remove its flag


0.3.0.1

(Released on: Wed Dec 23 13:41:49 UTC 2009)

* Tested with base-4.2

* Tested with text-0.7


0.3

(Released on:Tue Dec 8 21:06:22 UTC 2009)

* Moved the enumeration of usb devices in its own module:
  System.USB.Enumeration

* Moved the device descriptor inside the device type so that you can
  retrieve it without doing IO, e.g: deviceDesc :: Device ->
  DeviceDesc

* Moved the configuration descriptors inside the device descriptor so
  you can retrieve them without doing IO, e.g: deviceConfigs ::
  DeviceDesc -> [ConfigDesc]

* Implemented standard device requests that are missing from libusb.

* Made the timeout of I/O operations explicit. Now all I/O operations
  return an additional Bool that indicates if the operation has timed
  out. If an operation timed out does not mean there is no result, it
  just means that the result may be incomplete.

* Added experimental (and still untested) support for iteratees for
  doing predictable, high-performance, safe, and elegant input
  processing using the iteratee package. See module:
  System.USB.IO.Synchronous.Enumerator

* Fixed some asynchronous exception related bugs (put a needed
  bracket, block and unblock here and there).

* Finally some functions, constructors and types got renamed,
  documentation got updated and extended and some refactoring has
  taken place.
